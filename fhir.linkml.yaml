      related to unintended effects on a patient or research participant. The unintended
      effects may require additional monitoring, treatment, hospitalization, or may
      result in death. The AdverseEvent resource also extends to potential or avoided
      events that could have had such effects. There are two major domains where the
      AdverseEvent resource is expected to be used. One is in clinical care reported
      adverse events and the other is in reporting adverse events in clinical  research
      trial management. Adverse events can be reported by healthcare providers, patients,
      caregivers or by medical products manufacturers. Given the differences between
      these two concepts, we recommend consulting the domain specific implementation
      guides when implementing the AdverseEvent Resource. The implementation guides
      include specific extensions, value sets and constraints.
